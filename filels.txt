
To help you with removing this virus off your computer what I can do for you is to transfer you across to our virus removal specialist team. Would this be ok with you?

Although we, at Symantec, would like to be able to provide a
perfect antivirus solution that can never be circumvented, unfortunately that is not possible. No antivirus software is a guarantee against a computer becoming infected with a virus. It is a preventative measure that delivers very effective protection, but is not 100% foolproof. Norton AntiVirus, and the Norton security suite products that include Norton AntiVirus (like Norton 360), offer industry leading protection against virus infections on your computer. However, the effectiveness of the protection depends on certain conditions.
